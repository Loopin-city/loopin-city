# Admin Duplicate Community Management

## Overview
Loopin City uses an internal admin workflow to manage potential duplicate communities. When the system detects that a newly submitted community is very similar to an existing one, it flags the case for admin review.

## How It Works
- The system automatically identifies possible duplicates based on similarity scores.
- Admins review flagged cases and decide whether to merge, keep separate, or investigate further.
- This process ensures that the platform remains free of duplicate or fragmented community records.

## Benefits
- Maintains a clean and accurate community database.
- Prevents confusion and point splitting across similar communities.
- Provides an audit trail for all admin decisions.
