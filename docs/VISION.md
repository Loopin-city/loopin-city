# Loopin Platform Vision & Product Philosophy

## Purpose
Loopin is a centralized platform for discovering all technical events happening in a city. Our mission is to maximize the visibility and reach of local tech events by providing a single, easy-to-use listing platform.

## User Journey
1. **Event Discovery**
   - Users browse a list of upcoming tech events in their city.
2. **Event Details**
   - Clicking an event shows its details: title, date, time, venue, description, and organizer/community info (all provided during event submission).
3. **RSVP/Registration**
   - If interested, users click the event's RSVP/registration link and are redirected to the external form/page provided by the organizer.

## Platform Responsibilities
- **Centralized Visibility:** List all tech events for discovery.
- **Public Event Submission:** Anyone can submit an event (with community info) for admin review.
- **Admin Review & Community Verification:** Admins verify the event and the submitting community before publishing.
- **No RSVP Handling:** The platform only provides an external RSVP/registration link. No attendee management or ticketing is handled by Loopin.
- **No Organizer Dashboard:** There is no dashboard or event management for organizers/communities.

## Summary
Loopin is a discovery and visibility platform for tech events. We do not manage events, organizers, or attendees. Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to find and share tech events, and for organizers to reach a wider audience.
