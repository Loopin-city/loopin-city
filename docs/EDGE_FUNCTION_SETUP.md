# ðŸš€ Automated Cleanup System Overview

## What is the Cleanup System?
Loopin City uses an automated server-side cleanup system to keep event data fresh and leaderboards accurate. This system ensures that only relevant and successful events are counted, and that the platform remains up-to-date without manual intervention.

## How It Works
- The cleanup system runs automatically on a regular schedule.
- Past events are cleaned up, and event counts for communities and venues are updated.
- Leaderboards always reflect the most current and accurate data.

## Benefits
- No manual work requiredâ€”everything is handled automatically.
- Ensures a professional, reliable, and scalable platform experience.
- Keeps the community and venue leaderboards fair and up-to-date.
