# Duplicate Detection System: User Guide

## What Happens When You Submit an Event
- When you submit an event, Loopin City automatically checks if the community you entered already exists or is very similar to an existing one.
- The system uses advanced matching to detect duplicates, rebrands, or similar communities.

## What You Might See
- If a high-confidence match is found, your event will be linked to the existing community.
- If a possible match is found, the system may flag it for admin review before publishing.
- If no match is found, a new community will be created for your event.

## Why This Matters
- Prevents duplicate or fragmented community listings.
- Ensures your event reaches the right audience and is attributed to the correct community.
- Maintains accurate leaderboards and community records.

## Troubleshooting
- If your event or community isn't showing up as expected, check that your submission details are accurate and consistent.
- For further help, contact the Loopin City support team.
