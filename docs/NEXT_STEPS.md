## 🔒 **Next: Set Up GitHub Branch Protection Rules**

### **Step 1: Main Branch Protection**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/Loopin-city/loopin-city/settings/branches`
2. Click "Add rule" for `main` branch
3. Configure:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require approvals: 1
   - ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ Require review from code owners
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ✅ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
   - ❌ Allow force pushes: Disabled
   - ❌ Allow deletions: Disabled

### **Step 2: Develop Branch Protection**
1. Click "Add rule" for `develop` branch
2. Configure:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require approvals: 1
   - ✅ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ✅ Allow force pushes: Enabled
   - ❌ Allow deletions: Disabled

### **Step 3: Hotfix Branch Protection**
1. Click "Add rule" for `hotfix/*` pattern
2. Configure:
   - ✅ Require a pull request before merging
   - ✅ Require approvals: 1
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ❌ Require conversation resolution before merging: Disabled
   - ✅ Allow force pushes: Enabled

## 🚀 **Next: Set Up Render Staging Environment**

### **Step 1: Create Staging Service on Render**
1. Go to: `https://dashboard.render.com/`
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Connect to your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: `staging-loopin`
   - **Branch**: `develop`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start` (or your start command)
   - **Environment**: Same as production

### **Step 2: Environment Variables**
- Copy all environment variables from production
- Ensure staging uses same Supabase credentials
- Test that staging connects to production backend

### **Step 3: Test Staging Deployment**
1. Make a small change to `develop` branch
2. Push to trigger staging deployment
3. Verify staging environment works
4. Test that features work in staging

## 🧪 **Next: Set Up Automated Testing Pipeline**

### **Step 1: GitHub Actions Workflow**
Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run type-check  # if you add this script
```

### **Step 2: Add Type Checking Script**
Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Next: Test Complete Workflow**

### **Test Feature Development Workflow**
1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`
2. **Make changes** and test locally
3. **Push and create PR** to `develop`
4. **Verify checks pass** (build, lint, type-check)
5. **Merge to develop** → Should deploy to staging
6. **Test in staging** environment
7. **Create PR** from `develop` to `main`
8. **Merge to main** → Should deploy to production

### **Test Hotfix Workflow**
1. **Create hotfix branch** from `main`
2. **Fix issue** quickly
3. **Create PR directly to main**
4. **Fast approval and merge**
5. **Verify production deployment**

## 📋 **Manual Testing Checklist**

### **Before Each Deployment**
- [ ] **Build passes**: `npm run build`
- [ ] **Lint passes**: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **Type check passes**: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] **Local testing**: Feature works as expected
- [ ] **Mobile testing**: Works on phone
- [ ] **Cross-browser**: Works in Chrome, Safari, Firefox

### **After Staging Deployment**
- [ ] **Staging environment loads**
- [ ] **Feature works in staging**
- [ ] **No breaking changes**
- [ ] **Performance is acceptable**

### **After Production Deployment**
- [ ] **Production environment loads**
- [ ] **Feature works in production**
- [ ] **Monitor for any issues**
- [ ] **Ready for rollback if needed**

## 🚨 **Rollback Procedures**

### **Quick Rollback (Git)**
```bash
# Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# Or go back to specific commit
git checkout main
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin main
```

### **Render Rollback**
1. Go to Render dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy"
4. Choose previous deployment
5. Deploy
