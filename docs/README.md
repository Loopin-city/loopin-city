# Loopin City

Loopin City is an open-source platform for discovering and sharing local tech events, meetups, and opportunities. Our mission is to maximize the visibility and reach of local tech events by providing a single, easy-to-use listing platform.

## üöÄ Features
- Browse and search for upcoming tech events in your city
- Submit and manage your own events (admin-reviewed)
- Community-driven and open for collaboration
- No RSVP/ticketing handled by Loopin‚Äîjust external links to organizers
- No organizer dashboard; focus is on event discovery

## üåü Philosophy
- **Centralized Visibility:** List all tech events for discovery.
- **Public Event Submission:** Anyone can submit an event for admin review.
- **Admin Review & Community Verification:** Admins verify events and communities before publishing.
- **No Attendee Management:** Loopin only provides external RSVP/registration links.
- **No Organizer Dashboard:** Focus is on discovery, not management.
